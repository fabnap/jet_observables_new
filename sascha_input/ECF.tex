The C2 and D2 observables were found to be very powerful to distinguish between one- and two-prong like jets, see e.g., Ref.~\cite{bib:power_counting}. They are defined as ratios of the so called \textit{Energy Correlation Functions} ECF(N,$\beta$) which explore the substructure of a jet using a sum over the constituents. These variables are infrared and collinear-safe ($\beta\ge0$), as well as theoretically well understood, see Ref.~\cite{bib:analytic_ECF}. D2 was found to perform slightly better for tagging $W$ jets as C2 in Ref.~\cite{bib:w_tagging}, most notably due to a smaller correlation with \pt of the jet and somewhat higher background rejections. 

The energy correlation functions are defined as
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
 & \text{ECF(1)}  ={} \sum\limits_{\rm constituents} p_{\mathrm{T}}\,, \\ 
 & \text{ECF(2,$\beta$)} ={} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \sum\limits_{j=i+1}^n p_{\mathrm{T},i}p_{\mathrm{T},j}\Delta R_{ij}^{\,\beta}\,, \\ 
 & \text{ECF(3,$\beta$)} ={} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \sum\limits_{j=i+1}^n \sum\limits_{k=j+1}^n p_{\mathrm{T},i}p_{\mathrm{T},j}p_{\mathrm{T},k}(\Delta R_{ij} \Delta R_{ik} \Delta R_{jk})^{\,\beta}\,.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}\label{eq:ECF}
The constituents are correlated via a product of their $p_{\mathrm{T}}$, weighted by an angular factor, which is calculated from the pairwise angular distances of the considered constituents and is weighted by the exponent $\beta$. The default value for $\beta$ is 1, corresponding to angular and momentum parts being weighted equally. ECF(2,$\beta$) uses pair-wise correlation and is sensitive to two-prong structures. ECF(3,$\beta$) relies on triple-wise correlations to identify three-prong structures. ECF(1,$\beta$) corresponds to the $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ of the whole jet and serves as normalisation to minimise the dependence on the energy scale.


For collinear or soft configurations of $N$ constituents, ECF(N,$\beta$) acquires very small values. Given ECF(2,$\beta$), only well angular separated and non-soft constituent pairs act as non-negligible sum terms. This directly leads to the picture of two hard substructures inside the jet. A similar conclusion can be drawn for ECF(3,$\beta$) and three hard substructures. A jet with $N$ or more hard substructures features a higher ECF(N, $\beta$) value as a jet consisting of fewer than $N$ prongs. Consequently, the ratios C2 and D2 can be used to separate these topologies:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
 & \text{C2($\beta$)} ={} \frac{\text{ECF(3,$\beta$)}\cdot\text{ECF(1,$\beta$)}}{\text{ECF(2,$\beta$)}^2}\,,\\ 
 & \text{D2($\beta$)} ={} \frac{\text{ECF(3,$\beta$)}\cdot\text{ECF(1,$\beta$)}^3}{\text{ECF(2,$\beta$)}^3}\,.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}\label{eq:C2D2} 


A $W$ jet features a small ECF(3,$\beta$) but a high ECF(2,$\beta$) value resulting in small C2/D2, corresponding to a high agreement with the two-prong hypothesis. QCD jets feature a very small ECF(3,$\beta$) and a small ECF(2,$\beta$) value. Considering the power of ECF(2,$\beta$), this results in a higher C2/D2 value as for a $W$ jet. A $W$ tagging example for C2 and D2 with calorimeter clusters as input is given in Figure \ref{fig:ECF_example}.
