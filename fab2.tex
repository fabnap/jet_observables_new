% \subsection{Track-Assisted Mass ($\mta$)}
% The track-assisted mass, $\mta$, was one of the first attempts to combine the information form the tracker system and from the calorimeter. It is defined as $\mta=\frac{p_T^{calo}}{p_T^{track}}\times m^{track}$, where the $p_T^{track}$ and the $m^{track}$ are calculated from the tracks which are associated to the large-radius jet, adding up their 4-momenta (hence exploiting the superior angular resolution of the tracker system); the $p_T^{calo}$ is the transverse momentum as measured from the calorimeter system. The ratio $p_T^{calo}/p_T^{track}$ restores the fraction of the missing neutral component in the $m^{track}$.
% The $\mta$ has a better performance on the reconstruction of boosted objects such as $W/Z$ in the extreme kinematic regime ($\sim $ 1 TeV) and above in the transverse momentum of the decaying electroweak object. Another advantage of this observable shows up as it comes to the systematic uncertainties: in particular jet mass scale and jet mass resolution uncertainty on $\mta$ can be estimated by propagating the track reconstruction uncertainties and calorimeter-jet $\pt$ uncertainties through the definition of the variable given above. The tracking uncertainties are smaller for $\mta$ rather than $\mcal$ because a larger extent of the uncertainty cancels in the ratio $m^{track}/p_T^{track}$.
% Apart all of this advantages, the track-assisted mass shows its limits when it comes to intermediate transverse momentum regimes and below ($\pt < 1 $ TeV) in $W/Z$ and for Higgs and top quarks throughout the whole kinematic space.
% % The track-assisted mass, $\mta$, was one of the first attempts to combine the information form the tracker system and from the calorimeter. 
% % The track mass is missing the neutral component, i.e. each measurement is missing the fraction $\frac{neutral+charged}{charged}$, but it has very good angular resolution but $\pt$ resolution degrades linearly with the transverse momentum. The calorimeter mass, on the other hand, has the limitation of the angular resolution of the topo-clusters but relative energy resolution increases at higher energies. The missing neutral fraction from the tracker system could be corrected on a jet-by-jet basis taking advantage of the two detector sub-system optimalities: this leads to the definition of the \textit{track-assisted mass} ($m^{TA}$):
% % \begin{equation}
%  % m^{TA}=\frac{p_T^{calo}}{p_T^{track}}\times m^{track}
% % \end{equation}
% % The better resolution of the $\mta$ takes place at the scale of above $\sim1$ TeV of transverse momentum for $W/Z$, while the performance is suboptimal to the calorimeter mass for all the other samples considered.
% % Another advantage with respect to 
% Full description of this variable is given in the ATLAS CONF Note \cite{art35}.
% % The main limitation of the calorimeter mass comes from the angular resolution of the topo-clusters, which, for extreme kinematic regimes, start approaching each other at the point that they hit the granularity of the detector. The main advantage is that on the contrary the relative energy resolution increases at higher energies.

% % The tracks instead have a very good angular resolution, but $\pt$ relative resolution degrades linearly with the transverse momentum. 

% % One could then think about creating a variable which exploits the advantages of both and minimizes the disadvantages. As seen, the track mass is missing the neutral component, i.e. each measurement is missing the fraction $\frac{neutral+charged}{charged}$, but it could be corrected on a jet-by-jet basis: this leads to the definition of the \textit{track-assisted mass} ($m^{TA}$):
% % \begin{equation}
% %  m^{TA}=\frac{p_T^{calo}}{p_T^{track}}\times m^{track}
% % \end{equation}

% % It can be intuitively understood as follows: the term $m^{track}$ has the superior angular resolution, but misses the neutral component; the ratio $p_T^{calo}/p_T^{track}$, representing exactly the $(neutral+charged)/charged$ ratio, ``restores'' the correct value of the mass back to $charged+neutral$.

% %   \label{fig:mta1}
% % \end{figure}

% % From Figure \ref{fig:mta1} the comparison of the track-assisted mass and the calorimeter mass; the width of the distribution is smaller, making this observable a good candidate for usage.


% % \subsection{Advantages and Limitation of $\mta$}
% % The $\mta$ has a good handle on boosted $W/Z$, looking at all the transverse momentum spectrum for these results.

% % \begin{figure}[!ht]
% %   \centering
% %       \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{jet_part/uncert.png}
% %   \caption[Comparison of the uncertainties for $\mcal$ and $\mta$]{Comparison of the uncertainties for $\mcal$, on the left, and $\mta$, on the right the rise on the high jet $\pt$ is due to statistics. From the \cite{art35}.}
% %   \label{fig:uncert}
% % \end{figure}

% % Another big advantage which supports the use of the track-assisted mass is the relatively small uncertainties: in Figure \ref{fig:uncert} the comparison of $\mcal$ (left) and $\mta$ (right) fractional uncertainties on the JMS, shows how the tracking uncertainties are much smaller because of the ratio $m^{track}/p_T^{track}$. On the right plot the black line indicates the JMS fractional uncertainty for the $\mcal$, and is always above the $\mta$. Of course this introduces another argument in the development of new techniques, which is to look for a good balance between performance and small uncertainties: a perfect observable in terms of behavior which has very big uncertainties is not really useful.


% % When looking in the extreme kinematic regime, at very high $\pt$, as in the top plot in Figure \ref{fig:mta2}, the $\mta$ shows its real strength, achieving much smaller value of the IQnR.
% % However, there are some severe limitations which are worth noting, especially looking at the performance in different regions of transverse momentum: this is shown in the bottom plot of Figure \ref{fig:mta2}, where at a low $\pt$ it exhibits a much worse behavior.

% %     \label{fig:mta2}
% % \end{figure}


% % The performance in all the bins of $\pt$ can be studied looking at Figure \ref{fig:mta3}; these plots have as horizontal axis the transverse momentum and as vertical one the value of the $\iqr$ calculated from the correspondingly response. For $W/Z$ jets, there is a crossing point around $\pt\sim$1 TeV, which can be understood as the point in which the two subjet present start merging (subjet multiplicity shown in Figure \ref{fig:multi} in Appendix).



% % \subsubsection{Performance in $t\to q'\bar{q}b$ Decays}

% % For top quarks the situation is much different: with respect to $W/Z$ jets, in fact, there are two main disparities: on one side, the mass of the top quark is much higher than the one of the electroweak bosons, hence making the separation $\Delta R=\frac{2m}{\pt}$ bigger; on the other side, the decay is not anymore two-prong (two-subjet-like) but rather a three-prong  (three-subjet-like) decay, one from the b-jet and the other two from the $W$ decay.
% % $\mta$ is here never performing better than $\mcal$, as can be seen e.g. in Figure \ref{fig:mta3}, right.

% % For boosted Higgs the $\mcal$ outperforms the $\mta$ in the spectrum of transverse momentum. Although the decay is two-pronged, the mass of the Higgs is higher than the electroweak bosons, moreover another difference lays in light quarks initiated jets and heavy quarks initiated ones, like the b-quarks from Higgs decay.
% % % the b-jet poses an additional complication which comes from the branching ratio of B mesons to muons, which leave very little energy in the calorimeter system but additional tracks.

% \subsection{The Track-Assisted Subjet Mass ($\mtas$)}
% In this section the main outcome of the optimization of the large-radius jet mas reconstruction is presented: the \textit{track-assisted subjet mass} ($\mtas$).
% The main idea takes inspiration from the track-assisted mass: if one can use tracks to exploit the better angular resolution and correct the missing neutral component jet-by-jet, there is an additional information that can be used. The neutral fraction, in fact, varies stochastically not only per-jet basis, but even per-subjet basis, since the each quark follows a different parton showering and hadronization process.
% Correcting the missed neutral component per-subjet, it should perform better already at an intuitive level, as it accesses information from jet substructure.
% There are few question in the definition of this mass observable, whose answers are in the next section:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Regarding the inputs:
%   \begin{itemize}
%      \item How to select the set of tracks to be used?
%      \item Which kind of subjet should be used?
%   \end{itemize}
%   \item Regarding the procedure
%   \begin{itemize}
  
%   \item How to associate the tracks to a subjet?
%   \item How to correct for the missed neutrals on a subjet basis?
%   \item How to add everything back together?
%  \end{itemize} 
 
% \end{itemize}

% Those details are given in the next subsection.


% \subsection{Observable Definition: Inputs}
% There are two inputs to the $\mtas$: tracks and subjets. The definition of the standard inputs are give here; alternative approaches are given in subsection \ref{sec:alternate}.

% \subsubsection{Tracks}
% Only the tracks that satisfy the quality criteria and primary vertex association, described in the appendix \ref{sec:tracks}, are used.
% The tracks are additionally required to be ghost associated to the subjets of the groomed jet; namely only the subjets which survived the trimming procedure and are described in the next subsection.
% Ghost association provides a clear correspondence of tracks to the subjets set and was therefore chosen and preferred to other kind of assignments.

% \subsubsection{Subjets}

% The choice of subjets must follow a simple requirement: of course we want to take those which most likely come from the hard-scattering. This means that the choice of taking them after grooming is strongly favored.

% As grooming technique used, the trimming was preferred as being the standard in ATLAS and the most flexible one for optimization studies.

% The standard version of the trimming uses the k$_t$ reclustering algorithm with radius of 0.2, with the transverse momentum ratio $f_{cut}$ at 5\%.

% As shown later, this is also the optimal configuration for subjets.

% \subsection{Observable Definition: Procedure}
% Having tracks and subjets now well defined, we can describe the recipe to produce the $\mtas$. For brevity we will call the subjets SJ in the formulae below. 

% As said, the tracks are the ones ghost-associated to the subjets; however, tracks which fall inside the area of the large-$R$ jet, but not inside the subjets area, are still much probably coming from the hard-scattering. They are then associated again to the closest subjets via $\Delta R$ association.

% Each subjet will have at this point some tracks associated via ghost-association and some other via $\Delta R$ (which are maximally 5\%). We call this set of tracks, a ``custom'' Track-Jet or TJ.

% At this point, the one-to-one correspondence is preserved (for each SJ there is one and only one TJ), and we can move on correcting the neutral fraction.

% Getting inspired from the formula $m^{TA}=p_T^{calo}/p_T^{track}\times m^{track}$, we would like to replicate this at subjet level, i.e.

% $$\mtas="\sum_{SJ}"\frac{p_T^{SJ}}{p_T^{TJ}}\times m^{TJ}$$

% Where the summation symbol between quotation mark symbolize that the sum must be intended at 4-vector level: since now we are working inside the subjets, in fact, we need to change the subjet's 4-vector itself and not only the mass. If we call $p_\mu^{TJ}$ the Lorentz vector of the track-jet, 

% $$p_\mu^{TJ} = \spvec{m^{TJ};p_T^{TJ};\eta^{TJ};\phi^{TJ}} \to p_\mu^{TA}=\spvec{m^{TJ}\times\frac{p_T^{SJ}}{p_T^{TJ}} ;p_T^{SJ};\eta^{TJ};\phi^{TJ}} $$
 
% where $p_\mu^{TA}$ is the track-assisted subjet's 4-vector. If we label $i$ the $i$-th track-jet of the $N$ ones present in the large-$R$ jet,

% $$ \mtas=\sqrt{\left(\sum_i^N p^{TA} \right)_\mu \left(\sum_i^N p^{TA} \right)^{_\mu}} $$
 
% \begin{figure}[!ht]
%   \centering

%   \caption[Pictorial event display]{Pictorial event display showing the $\eta$ $\phi$ region of a large-$R$ anti-k$_t$ trimmed jet, (in blue the catchment area of the anti-k$_t$) showing the different k$_t$ subjets: they are highlighted in green, fuchsia and yellow. The associated track-jets (here indicated as arrows pointing the calorimeter area) are colored with the same color of the correspondent subjet. Some tracks associated with $\Delta R$ procedure can be seen in the fuchsia subjet. The transverse momenta and mass values are also shown for the subjets.}
%   \label{fig:mtas1}
% \end{figure}

% An important remark is that, in the case of a large-$R$ jet with only one subjet, the $\mtas$ has exactly the same definition of the $\mta$. This implies, since the angular separation of the decay product scales inversely with $\pt$, that the performance should approach the one of the $\mta$ at very high transverse momenta. However, the space for improvement is precisely in the low-intermediate $\pt$ regime.

\subsection{Performance in $W \to q'\bar{q}$ Decays}
The $W/Z$ decay was the first one looked at, and with which the $\mtas$ was designed. The $\mcal$ shows a fast deterioration of the performance at high $\pt$, and, as shown in the previous section, the $\mta$ prevents this deterioration but suffers at low transverse momenta ($\pt<1$ TeV).
The $\mtas$ has a similar behavior in the extreme transverse momentum regime as the $\mta$, since the subjet multiplicity peaks at one, where there are no differences between the two observables.
In the low-$\pt$ regime, on the contrary, it exploits the difference in charged to neutral ratio for each subjet, achieving a better performance.
This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:mtas2} as a function of $\pt$: below $\sim$ 1 TeV achieves lower values of the IQnR converging from below to the $\mta$ as the number of subjets decreases to one.

\subsection{Performance in $h\to b\bar{b}$ Decays}
In the Randall-Sundrum graviton to di-Higgs to four b-quark, the performance is again problematic for the $\mta$ with respect to $\mcal$, which is far beyond the latter, while the performance of the $\mtas$ is partially similar to the top-quark decay, but degrades much more in the extreme $\pt$ regime, following the $\mta$. Shown in Figure \ref{fig:mtas4}.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Performance in $t\to q'\bar{q}b$ Decays}
The top decays are shown on Figure \ref{fig:mtas3}; the $\mtas$ is comparable yet slightly worse than the $\mcal$ in the low-middle $\pt$ regime, while degrades at higher $\pt$ approaching the $\mta$, which is far beyond the track-assisted subjet mass in performance.
As already noted, the worse performance can be ascribed both to the higher top-quark mass, and to its different and more complex decay topology.

\subsection{Performance in QCD Multijet Events}
The behavior of the QCD multijet sample is similar to the $W/Z$ sample, where the $\mta$ exhibits a crossing point in the middle-low regime $\pt\simeq900$ GeV and proceeds with a better performance at high transverse momenta.
Again the $\mtas$ follows this similarity showing no crossing point and an optimal overall behavior, both with respect to calorimeter- and track-assisted-based mass definition. On Figure \ref{fig:mtas5}.

  \label{fig:mtas5}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Performance in Massive $\tilde{W}\to q'\bar{q}$ Decays with $m_{\tilde{W}}=m_t$}
The massive $W$ sample is a special sample which was used to understand the behavior of top jets, whether its worse resolution was coming from the higher mass of the top quark or from the more complex decay topology (three-pronged instead of two-pronged decay and $b$-quark presence). 
The sample is almost identical to the $W/Z$ one ($W'\to WZ$) but in this case the SM electroweak boson have the mass of the top quark $m_{\tilde{W}}=m_t$.
In fact, from the rule $\Delta R\simeq 2m/p_T$, a bigger separation is expected between quarks from the hadronic decay.
The comparison with $\mcal$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:mtas6}, together with the top-quark jet for completeness. As seen here, the performance of the latter is clearly worse than the former, the trend is yet very similar. This difference is interpreted in terms of different and more complex topology and hence higher subjet multiplicity: in the three subjet structure, resolving accurately the components is more challenging.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Stability of Mean of Response and Left-Hand-Side Integral }
The stability of the $\mtas$ was checked, although the IQnR is already a good quantifier of stability, explicitly for the mean of the mass response distribution and for the left-hand-side tail, as a function of the transverse momentum. This was an important check to assure the overall gaussianity of the final distribution in the whole spectrum of $\pt$, and suitability in regards of the calibration step, which is not discussed in this note.

The mean of the response distribution is shown for $W/Z$ decays in Figure \ref{fig:meanandtail}, left; as seen here, despite the mean being constantly below unity, its behavior is much more flat and independent of $\pt$, especially in the low-intermediate regime. This is surprising since the $\mcal$ is already shown after the calibration step, which is not taken instead for the $\mtas$. Conversely the left-hand-side tail of the mass response which is shown in the same figure, right, shows a more enhanced behavior than the $\mcal$, but still never reaches the 10\%. Of course an enhancement of the tail causes a loss of gaussianity and a number of jets which are reconstructed with a lower mass than they should, but it is still comparable with the calorimeter mass.

Those quantifiers show analogous behavior for the other samples considered and those figures can be found in the Appendix.

\subsection{Potential Improvements from Subjet Calibration}

An additional attempt of calibrating the subjet was also tried and, although the results were not substantially improved, it is presented in this subsection. This study was performed using only $W/Z$ samples.

% \subsection{Preliminary Studies on Subjet Calibration}
The \textit{perfect calibration} refers to the procedure of using $\mtas$ with truth-level information for calorimeter and tracker system, i.e. looking at the best possible scenario with an ideal detector. The performance is of course expected to be optimal, because of the use of the truth-level. This step was necessary as feasibility study, to understand whether ulterior efforts in this direction were meaningful.
% The first attempt in calibrating the subjets had as start a ``perfect calibration'', which means using the truth-level information from the MC sample \textit{before} the interaction with the calorimeter.
Truth-level tracks are the particles in the jet which have an electric charge and are stable, truth-level subjets are all the particles, charged and not, which are ghost associated to the calorimeter subjets.
There are few possibilities in doing so, here some nomenclature for this study will be introduced:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\mtas$ using truth-level subjets and tracks; normal tracks (with all detector effects) are used to assist the truth-level subjets;
 \item $\mtas$ using truth-level tracks and truth-level subjets; the truth-level tracks are used to assist the truth-level subjets;
 \item $\mcal$ truth, calculated using only the truth subjets.
\end{itemize}


% \subsubsection{Perfect Calibration}

%   \caption[Perfect calibration]{Performance of the perfect calibration, using truth-level subjets and truth-level tracks. It shows room for improvement especially at low-middle $\pt$.}
%   \label{fig:perfcalib}
% \end{figure}


\subsubsection{Simple Subjet Calibration}
The perfect calibration using truth level subjets and tracks is shown in Figure \ref{fig:perfcalib4} in blue dots; since the performance exhibits room for big improvement below $\sim$ 1 TeV and moderate to small improvement above this value, the second step of a simple calibration was tried.

Following the example of calibration of jets in general, a simple approach to emulate this procedure was tried, constructing in various bins of transverse momenta the responses of the subjet's energy to derive the weights factors to be applied. The detailed procedure is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Responses in energy $R_E=E^{reco}/E^{truth}$ were built in several bins of $\pt$, spanning to the whole transverse momentum range;
 \item The mean $\mu_R$ of this response was calculated via a fit to the Gaussian core;
 \item Those values (\textit{scale factors}) were stored and applied again to the subjets before the computation of the $\mtas$ via 4-momentum correction $E'=E/\mu_R$; the $\pt$ (the value which only enters the $\mtas$ variable) was changed then correspondingly to keep the subjet's mass constant.
\end{enumerate}

This procedure was called \textit{poor man's calibration} or PM calibration or \textit{simple calibration}.
A check on the $\pt$ response before and after calibration together with the mean of the entire Large-$R$ jet response is shown in Figure \ref{fig:calibA} and \ref{fig:calibA2} in Appendix.

The results are on Figure \ref{fig:perfcalib4}; there are only marginal improvements in few ranges of low transverse momentum where the scale factors are further away from unity, and the overall observable is not performing better than the standard $\mtas$. This is interpreted both in terms of a missing calibration as a function of the $\eta$ variables (having hence a befit from the crack region) and because the correction done on average does not provide the sufficient handle in a jet-by-jet basis, especially when all the subjets are rescaled by similar factors (which translates into a similarity of $\pt$s of the subjets, often the case for e.g. $W/Z$ decays, less for tops jets entirely contained in the large-$R$ jet).

\subsection{Limitation of $\mtas$ from tracking}
The final effort to understand the various and competing effects, which take place in the $\mtas$ brought to a final study on the variable to understand the reason for the worsening of the resolution at high transverse momenta, using the truth MC information.

First of all the track mass resolution was studied: a response of the mass of the tracks associated to the jet ($m^{track}$) was constructed, using the truth-level tracks.

The result is shown on Figure \ref{fig:trackdegrade}: for the samples considered, it shows a linear degradation of the $m^{track}$, both for massive and SM $W/Z$.

  \label{fig:trackdegrade}
\end{figure}
% ***change figures with the one in appendix***
The hypothesis of the degradation of the $\mtas$ driven by the tracks is also supported by the Figure \ref{fig:breakdown2} and \ref{fig:breakdown3}, where the truth-level tracks are used instead of real tracks to compute the variable; the flat behavior at high $\pt$ ascribes the worsening of the resolution to tracks at higher transverse momenta.
In particular the black dots show the $\mtas$ using truth-level subjets but real tracks for the track assistance procedure.
Even combining this truth-level information, in fact, it shows a large worsening of the performance (truth-level subjets only are shown as blue dots).
On the other side using again truth-level tracks for the track assistance procedure of the truth-level subjet, shows a recovery of the loss in performance.

% Particularly interesting is the black dots, which 
% uses truth-level subjet but real tracks, which worsen the overall performance of the truth-level subjet alone (shown in light blue dots).

% \chapter{Limitation of the $\mtas$}
% Additional studies on the limitation of the $\mtas$ based on MC studies without detector interactions are also presented. In particular, the truth study presented for $W/Z$ decay in were extended for top quark decays.

% As seen on Figure \ref{fig:breakdown3}, the breakdown of the $\mtas$ shows that, in particular for the high transverse momenta regimes, the tracks are subjected to fast degradation which makes their combination with the calorimeter mass not anymore an advantage. 
In particular for the top decay, the breakdown shows that the track degradation is not anymore compensated by the calorimeter for high $\pt$, making their combination not anymore an advantage.

% This limitation was expected and understood from the detector performance point of view, with the variables which are presented here $\mta$ and $\mtas$ to reach a competitive standpoint with the $\mcal$ in the extreme kinematic regime for the top quark decay.

In black, in fact, the performance of the $\mtas$ variable using tracks with detector effect and subjets without those effects, shows this intrinsic limit which takes place already at 1.5 TeV.

The crossing point is, as already pointed out for the top jets, present because of the optimal performance of the calorimeter system caused by the higher mass of the top quark, and partially also because of its more complex decay structure and difficulty to be resolved in subjets.

% \subsection{Large-R jet: Calibration}
% The jet mass scale calibration aims to correct the reconstructed jet mass to the particle-level jet mass by applying calibration factors derived from a sample of simulated QCD multijet events, with an analogous procedure described in \ref{sec:calib} for the jet energy scale.

\subsection{Performance with Alternate Inputs to the $\mtas$}
\label{sec:alternate}

There are quite a few ways to modify the track-assisted subjet mass; however, all the alternative approaches showed worse performance, and they are mentioned here for completeness only.
The per-track four momentum correction scheme which is used for the ECF and the n-Subjettiness and also explored with the $\mtas$ with no significant difference was described in \ref{sec:tas}.

The other alternatives considered were: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item for the tracks:
 \begin{itemize}
   \item use of tracks not as input directly, but only taking those belonging to anti-k$_t$ reclustered track-jet with radius of 0.3 or 0.2;
   \item tighter or looser quality conditions were explored;
   \item tighter or looser primary vertex association requirement were explored.
 \end{itemize}
 \item for the subjets:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item the trimming procedure was modified: various radii $R_{sub}$ of the subjets were tested;
   \item the subjets were reclustered using not only the standard k$_t$, but also anti-k$_t$ and C/A.
  \end{itemize}
  \item for the procedure: different 4-momentum correction scheme was also studied in more details, see \ref{sec:tas}.
\end{itemize}

The different reclustering algorithm choice has a deep impact and was studied in details, since it changes the topo-cluster added to the subjets and the tracks associated to them. The situation is depicted in the event-display in Figure \ref{fig:evtdspl}; the display on the left shows the standard choice of k$_t$, the one on the right shows the modified approach anti-k$_t$. 

In Figure \ref{fig:allalgow} \ref{fig:allalgotop} \ref{fig:allalgohiggs} the performance for $W/Z$, tops and Higgs jets are shown, respectively. It can be seen that the k$_t$ algorithm provides the best observable definition, in all the samples considered. However, the anti-k$_t$ algorithm provides similar performances; this was an important check as the jet calibration procedure currently going on in ATLAS, the \textit{R-Scan} procedures includes the anti-k$_t$ algorithm with radius of R=0.2 and aims at providing the calibration and uncertainties that could be used directly in the computation of the $\mtas$.

\section{Performance of Combined Calorimeter and Track-Assisted SubJet Mass}
This section presents the achievement of the variable obtained combining the $\mtas$ and the $\mcal$, the $\mcombtas$ with respect to the combination of the $\mta$ and the $\mcal$, the $\mcomb$. Both these variables were defined in \ref{subsec:comb}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Performance in $W \to q'\bar{q}$ Decays}
On the $W/Z$s decays, the $\mcombtas$ outperforms all the other definitions throughout all the transverse momentum space; on Figure \ref{fig:mcombtas3} they are shown for reference together with the $\mtas$. It can be noted here that the track-assisted subjet mass, although being sub-optimal, has comparable performance, yet presenting fewer complications due to the combination procedure.

The Higgs and top jets presents the same properties as shown before, and the combined mass reflects these properties. }
\end{figure}

\subsection{Performance in $h\to b\bar{b}$ Decays}
Again, for the Higgs decay there are similarities as for the top sample; on Figure \ref{fig:mcombtas5} the two definitions of the combined mass, together with the simpler $\mtas$. Although this variable is slightly sub-optimal yet still comparable in the low to intermediate range in transverse momenta, where the tracks are driving a decrease in performance for the high to very-high $\pt$. The $\mcombtas$ uses this advantage to achieve optimal behavior in the entire transverse momentum spectrum, outperforming both $\mcal$ and $\mcomb$ almost everywhere.


\subsection{Performance in $t\to q'\bar{q}b$ Decays}
The top decay remains the most challenging phenomenon also with the combined mass; as seen on Figure \ref{fig:mcombtas4}, the $\mcomb$ performs quite similarly to the calorimeter based mass definition, behaving considerably better than the $\mtas$ especially at high transverse momentum. The $\mcombtas$, however, outperforms all the other definitions, and shows its optimal observable strength at intermediate $\pt$ i.e. in the range $0.8 < \pt < 1.6$ TeV.
