\AtlasAbstract{%
This note presents a novel approach to reconstruct jet substructure observables using subjet-assisted tracks. The momentum scale of these tracks is ``assisted'', i.e., calibrated, to the momentum scale provided by the subjets of a groomed large-radius jet.
%that the tracks are matched to. 
This approach combines the excellent angular resolution of the tracker with the superior energy measurement of the calorimeter, which takes neutral particles into account.
\\
The performance of this novel technique is studied using simulated MC events  with hadronic decays of $W$, $Z$, and Higgs bosons, as well as top quarks. A particular focus is placed on the invariant mass of the groomed large-radius jet, the single most discriminant observable against QCD multijet background. An improvement by up to 40\% in resolution is found for the jet mass reconstructed from subjet-assisted tracks $m^\textrm{TAS}$ relative to the traditional approach using the calorimeter only. 
\\
Beyond this, jet substructure observables widely used within ATLAS like the Energy Correlation Functions, $n$-subjettiness, C2, D2, $\tau_{21}$, and $\tau_{32}$ are studied. Here, an improvement in QCD multijet rejection rate by up to 100\% is found for the same identification efficiency of hadronic decays of $W$, $Z$, and Higgs bosons, as well as top quarks. An improvement by up to 50\% is found when using tracks topologically matched to subjets of the groomed large-radius jets. A strategy for the evaluation of systematic uncertainties is proposed.
