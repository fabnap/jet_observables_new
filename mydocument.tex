\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Jets are collimated streams of particles resulting from quarks and gluons fragmentation and hadronisation.
The distribution of energy inside a jet contains information about the initiating particle. When a massive
particle such as a top quark, Higgs boson or W/Z bosons is produced with significant Lorentz boost and decays into
quarks, the entire hadronic decay may be captured inside a single jet. The mass of such jets (jet mass)
is one of the most powerful tools for distinguishing massive particle decays from the continuum multijet
background; the ratios of Energy Correlation Functions C2 and D2 (see Reference \cite{bib:ECF}) and n-Subjettiness $\tau_{21}$ and $\tau_{32}$ (see Reference \cite{bib:nsub}) provide an ad-hoc tool purposely developed for the multijet background and constitute a fundamental part of many for boson taggers.
This note documents the so-called subjet-assisted techniques with the ATLAS detector. 
The track-assisted subjet mass $m^{TAS}$ definition is presented and confronted with the standard development in ATLAS, $m^{comb}$ and $m^{TA}$. 
Energy Correlation Functions and n-Subjettiness with the modified subjet-assisted technique are presented and confronted with the standard one in ATLAS.
The note ends with conclusions for the jet observables using subjet-assisted tracks.

\section{Uncertainties on observables with sub-jet-assisted tracks}
This chapter gives a brief overview of the uncertainties on the track-assisted (sub-jet) mass variable. 
For $\mta$ the uncertainties are smaller than calorimeter-based jet mass variables because of the way it is constructed, $\mta=m^{trk}\times p_T^{calo}/p_T^{trk}$: the ratio $m^{trk}/p_T^{trk}$ causes a cancellation of the tracking uncertainties to a large extent, which are smaller than $\mcal$. The remaining term $p_T^{calo}$ is the additional one where uncertainties on this variable need to be evaluated with special care.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

      \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{jet_part/uncert.png}
  \caption[Comparison of the uncertainties for $\mcal$ and $\mta$]{Comparison of the uncertainties for $\mcal$, on the left, and $\mta$, on the right the rise on the high jet $\pt$ is due to statistics. From the \cite{art35}.}
  \label{fig:uncert}
\end{figure}


For what concerns the $\mtas$, the tracking uncertainties are expected to be identical to the $\mta$, because of the identical use of tracks in both variables, as also discussed in the BOOST Conference Note \cite{art35}.
The only significant difference in this regard of $\mta$ with respect to $\mtas$ is the $p_T^{jet}$ instead of the $p_T^{subjet}$: the uncertainties in the first one are calculated in-situ using $p_T$ balance methods, and they are generally well-behaved; for the second one, the uncertainties are also expected to lay in the same order of magnitude. In Figure \ref{fig:uncert} the comparison of the uncertainties for the $\mcal$ on the left and $\mta$ on the right shows the smaller fractional JMS uncertainties in the use of the track-assisted method.

The path to bring $\mtas$ ready to usage needs of course to evaluate the uncertainties on the  $p_T^{subjet}$ which can be provided with the R-Scan procedure which includes the anti-k$_t$ subjet of radius of 0.2; those were already showed to have a similar performance of the k$_t$ subjet used as standard.

The $\mtas$ moreover is expected to have little to none benefit from the calibration procedure which could be provided from the R-Scan as well, as already shown and discussed in the previous chapter.

\section{Conclusions \& Outlook}
\label{sec:conclusions}
%----------------------------------
% \subsection{Jet mass observables}
The \mtas variable was developed for the large-$R$ jet mass; it combines the information of the tracker- and calorimeter-system to achieve an higher precision in the jet mass reconstruction, correcting the missed neutral fraction which is absent in the tracker but not in the calorimeter.
With respect to the $\mta$, it applies this correction at sub-jet by sub-jet level and not at jet by jet level, therefore providing a more accurate reconstruction. 
It was shown in Monte Carlo simulation to be a very good observable confronting quantitatively with the other definitions which are either standard or in preparation, $\mcal$, $\mta$ and $\mcomb$.
% In fact, it behaves better in terms of $\iqr$ and all the other ways to look at the figure of merit, the mass response, for the boosted $W/Z$ and QCD sample; is always better than the $\mta$ and similar to the $\mcal$ for the boosted tops and Higgs.
% Moreover, it is a slightly worse observable than the $\mcomb$, yet being comparable, and avoiding the development of ad-hoc weights.
The optimal configuration of $\mtas$ is shown and confronted with different approaches, in particular in terms of different trimming procedure of the large-$R$ jet to be used as an input.
All the components of the observable have been studied with the use of truth Monte Carlo information without detector effect, in order to evaluate quantitatively its limits and strengths; the track $\pt$ measure degradation was found to be the cause of the variable decreasing performance at higher transverse momenta.

The $\mcombtas$ is the logical extension of the $\mtas$, which improves by construction the results beyond the $\mcal$ and the $\mtas$, combining these two variables on the same way of the $\mcomb$, but taking into account the higher correlation factor which is inherited from the sub-jet usage.
Weights for its construction can be in both cases either derived specifically for the sample considered, or constructed on average with the QCD sample, in this case getting a sub-optimal performance. 
In all the cases studied, it has a better behavior than the $\mcomb$, $\mcal$ and $\mta$.

% \subsubsection{Outlook}
% The outlook of the $\mtas$ and $\mcombtas$ variables follows two main scenarios, concerning the calibration and uncertainties determination which are necessary to get this observables ready to be used. The procedure involved are already fully understood, since the the same was applied or is being applied for the $\mta$ and $\mcomb$.

% For the simple scenario here the procedure that would take place is the direct Monte Carlo calibration of the $\mtas$, aiming at correcting the reconstructed jet mass to the particle-level jet mass by applying the calibration factors derived from QCD multijet events, an analogous procedure to the one described in Section \ref{sec:calib} for the jet energy scale.

% The more complex scenario considers an additional calibration to the subjet with R=0.2, which is already at an advanced stage within ATLAS for anti-k$_t$ reclustering algorithm (it has a slightly worse performance than k$_t$, as presented previously). 

% The uncertainties are expected to be similar to the one which were derived for the $\mta$ and which are compared to the $\mcal$ on Figure \ref{fig:uncert}; the tracking uncertainties are smaller for the track-assisted mass because of the ratio $m^{track}/p_T^{track}$ and will be smaller as well for the track-assisted  sub-jet mass since it uses the same ratio.

% In-situ uncertainties were derived for the $\mta$ with a sample of enriched top-quark; the same technology used here can be applied to the $\mtas$.

% In the more complex scenario, the uncertainties could be derived for the subjet R=0.2 reclustered with anti-k$_{t}$.
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Energy Correlation Functions and n-Subjettiness}

The performance of the Energy Correlation Functions and n-Subjettiness observables was studied with tracks and subjet-assisted tracks (TAS) compared to the default calculation with calorimeter clusters. The assisting procedure for these observables is the same single-track scaling method used for $\mtas$. It was shown, that the better angular resolution of tracks can help to reduce the QCD background in boosted $W$, Higgs and Top tagging cases, especially for very high energies. Optimal results can be achieved by tuning the angular weighting to slightly higher values. In our study, a value of $\beta=1.7$ yield the highest background rejections in most of the cases. 

Subjet-assisted tracks performed superior for lower and intermediate boosts. At very high energies, the assisting was shown to loose effect on the studied observables and tracks and TAS equally outperform the cluster based variables in terms of QCD rejection.

For the three cases of $W$, Higgs and Top tagging, the optimal variables were identified and the $p_{\text{T}}$ behavior of the cut-value for two different working points were studied. 

%For the very conclusion, both the variables constructed in the work of this thesis, $\mtas$ and $\mcombtas$, exhibit a better performance of their counterparts, $\mta$ and $\mcomb$, which are now ready to be use or in preparation within the ATLAS collaboration, and share the same advantages -and disadvantages. Further steps are necessary to get this observables to usage: calibration and uncertainties.

%%Sascha: Adding my stuff to this part if OK
For the very conclusion, the variables constructed in the work of this study, $\mtas$ and $\mcombtas$, as well as the TAS and track based C2/D2/$\tau_{21}$/$\tau_{32}$, exhibit a better performance as their counterparts, $\mta$ and $\mcomb$, respectively JSS observables calculated from topo-clusters. The introduced observables are now ready to use or in preparation within the ATLAS collaboration, and share the same advantages -and disadvantages. Further steps are necessary to get this observables to usage: calibration (mass) and uncertainties (mass and further substructure observables).
